# A Simple Demo for Haptic Feedback in iOS 11

Apple implements haptic feedback throughout almost all elements of iOS from rich-notifications on the lock screen to confirming a successful transaction in Apple Pay, even on scroll wheels and sliders. It is important to make a user more confident in the actions they perform, and using the haptic engine to portray messages is a great way of confirming a message you want the user to receive.

Lucky for us, Apple has made implementing specific feedback patterns really easy for us so this will be a relatively short tutorial. Lets break down some of these different classes weâ€™re supplied:

1. UIImpactFeedbackGenerator
2. UISelectionFeedbackGenerator
3. UINotificationFeedbackGenerator
